# Documentation for Book Preview and Theme Management Code

## Introduction
This documentation explains the purpose and functionality of the provided code. The code handles two main functionalities:
1. Managing a theme (dark or light mode) based on user preference or system settings.
2. Creating a book preview list with the ability to filter and display additional books as needed.

## Theme Management

### `theme` Object
The `theme` object manages the application's theme (dark or light mode). It includes methods to initialize, apply, and toggle themes based on user preferences or system settings.

#### Properties
- `isDarkMode`: Indicates whether dark mode is enabled. Initially set to `null`.
- `darkThemeVars`: An object containing CSS variables for dark mode.
  - `colorDark`: CSS variable for dark color in dark mode.
  - `colorLight`: CSS variable for light color in dark mode.
- `lightThemeVars`: An object containing CSS variables for light mode.
  - `colorDark`: CSS variable for dark color in light mode.
  - `colorLight`: CSS variable for light color in light mode.

#### Methods
- `init()`: Initializes the theme based on the user's system preference. Calls `applyTheme()` to set the theme.
- `applyTheme()`: Applies the theme by setting CSS variables and updating the UI.
- `toggleTheme()`: Toggles between dark and light mode and applies the theme using `applyTheme()`.

### Usage
To use the `theme` object, call `theme.init()` on page load. Users can toggle the theme using the `toggleTheme()` method.


### Personal Struggles and Challenges
Throughout the process of breaking the code into web components and integrating it into my project, I encountered several challenges. Despite my efforts to understand and implement the required functionality, I struggled with various aspects of JavaScript and the intricacies of creating web components. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to ensure that the theme management and book preview list worked seamlessly together. Testing the code multiple times often resulted in unexpected issues that I found difficult to debug on my own. It was only with assistance in the final stages that I was able to get the code running correctly. This experience highlighted the need for more time and practice to fully grasp these concepts, and I plan to revisit this project to improve my understanding and proficiency.

## Conclusion
This code provides functionality for theme management and creating a dynamic book preview list. The `theme` object handles dark and light modes, while the rest of the code creates and manages book previews, filters, and various user interactions. This detailed documentation should help you understand and work with the code more effectively.
